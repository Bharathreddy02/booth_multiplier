# Booth Multiplier in Verilog

This repository contains the implementation of Booth's Multiplier using Verilog. Booth's Multiplier is an efficient algorithm for multiplying binary numbers.

## Algorithm Overview

Booth's algorithm performs multiplication of two signed binary numbers in 2's complement notation. The algorithm examines adjacent pairs of bits of the multiplier and based on the pair (00, 01, 10, 11), it decides to add, subtract, or shift the product register.
